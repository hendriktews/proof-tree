    This information can look like one of the folling lines:

    [(dependent evars: ?35 open, ?36 using ?42 ?41 , ?42 open,) ]

    [(dependent evars: ?35 open, ?36 using ?42 ?41 , ?42 using ,)]

    This function returns a tuple, where the first element is the list
    of open, uninstantiated existential variables. The second element
    is a list of pairs, where each pair contains an instantiated
    existential variable and the list of variables that are used in its
    instantiation.

    If parsing dies with an exception, a suitable error dialog is 
    displayed.
