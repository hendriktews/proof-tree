           prooftree --- proof tree display for Proof General
============================================================================


Prooftree is a program for proof tree visualization during interactive
proof development in a theorem prover. It is currently being developed for
Coq and Proof General. See http://askra.de/software/prooftree/ for more
information.

Prooftree requires the (cvs) development version of Proof General
and Coq version >= 8.4beta. These versions of Proof General and Coq must be
installed separately. A binary package for Debian Squeeze i386 is available
on the Prooftree website.


============================================================================
  USAGE
============================================================================

Start Emacs and load any Coq file. Proof display with prooftree is
initially disabled. To enable it, hit the prooftree tool-bar icon, select
menu Proof-General -> Start/Stop Prooftree or type C-c C-d. If you are
inside a proof any of these actions will launch a proof-tree display for
the current proof. Otherwise prooftree will be launched as soon as you
start the next proof. Comprehensive usage information is provided by the
help menu item inside Prooftree and by the Prooftree man page.


============================================================================
CREDITS / CONTACT / COPYRIGHT
============================================================================

Prooftree is more or less a reimplementation of the graphical proof display
of Pvs. The Pvs version is implemented in Tcl/Tk and controlled directly by
the Pvs prover process, which has some advantages over the prooftree
approach.

Instructions about adding support for a new proof assistant is contained in
the Proof General Adapting manual.
