           prooftree --- proof tree display for Proof General
============================================================================


Prooftree is a program for proof tree visualization during interactive
proof development in a theorem prover. It is currently being developed for
Coq and Proof General. See http://askra.de/software/prooftree/ for more
information.

Currently prooftree only works with a special development version of Proof
General (cvs version branch ProofTreeBranch) and a patched version of 
Coq 8.3pl2. It is therefore strongly suggested that you download a
consistent bundle of Proof General and prooftree together with a suitable
patch for Coq from the prooftree website. 


============================================================================
  PREREQUISITES
============================================================================

You need ocaml with the Gtk bindings from the LablGtk2 library installed.
The configure script checks if 

    ocamlopt.opt -I +lablgtk2 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx

runs without errors. For Debian installing the packages ocaml-nox and
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev suffice.


============================================================================
  INSTALLATION
============================================================================

1. Configure with

   ./configure

   optionally supply -prefix <dir> or -bindir <dir> to set the installation
   directories. 

2. Compile with

   make all

3. Acquire the necessary rights and install with

   make install


============================================================================
  EMACS CONFIGURATION
============================================================================

Before you can enjoy prooftree you have to configure Emacs to find
prooftree and use the right versions of Proof General and Coq. Of course
you have to disable any other setting that select a particular Proof
General or Coq version.

1. Prooftree is controlled by Proof General as a subprocess of Emacs. You
   therefore have to make sure Emacs loads the right version of Proof
   General (from the ProofTreeBranch). Put

   (load-file "<pg-dir>/generic/proof-site.el")

   in your .emacs, where <pg-dir> is the installation directory of the
   ProofTreeBranch version of Proof General.

2. Further, you have to ensure that Proof General launches the Coq version
   with the ID patches. 

   Either globally set coq-prog-name by inserting

   (setq coq-prog-name "<coq-id-dir>/bin/coqtop")

   into your .emacs or extend Emacs' exec-path by inserting

   (setq exec-path (cons "<coq-id-dir>/bin" exec-path))

   into your .emacs. In both cases <coq-id-dir> stands for the installation
   directory of Coq containing the ID patches.

3. If you installed prooftree in a non-standard location, you have to set
   proof-tree-program: Put

   (setq proof-tree-program "<pt-dir>/bin/prooftree")

   where <pt-dir> is the prooftree installation directory. (Alternatively
   you can extend exec-path, see point 2 above.)


============================================================================
  USAGE
============================================================================

Start Emacs and load any Coq file. Proof display with prooftree is
initially disabled. To enable it, select menu 

Proof-General -> Start/Stop Prooftree or type C-c C-d. If you are inside a
proof this command will launch a proof-tree display for the current proof.
Otherwise prooftree will be launched as soon as you start the next proof.

CREDITS / CONTACT / COPYRIGHT
============================================================================

Prooftree is more or less a reimplementation of the graphical proof display
of Pvs. The Pvs version is implemented in Tcl/Tk and controlled directly by
the Pvs prover process, which has some advantages over the prooftree
approach.
