  PREREQUISITES
============================================================================

Make sure you have Proof General later than March 2021 and Coq 8.11 or
better.

If you want to install Prooftree from sources you need OCaml with the Gtk
bindings from the LablGtk2 library installed. The configure script checks
if

    ocamlopt.opt -I +lablgtk2 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx

runs without errors. For Debian, installing the packages ocaml-nox and
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev suffice (but the package ocaml-native-compilers is
strongly recommended for binary compilation). For opam, package lablgtk
must be installed.


============================================================================
  INSTALLATION
============================================================================

1. Configure with

   ./configure

   optionally supply -prefix <dir> or -bindir <dir> to set the installation
   directories. The configure script does trial-and-error to find LablGtk2.
   You might therefore see spurious compilation errors. If the script is
   successful, it prints "Configuration successful." together with a
   summary.

2. Compile with

   make all

3. This step only installs the man page and the executable. You can omit
   this step and run the prooftree executable out of this directory. If you
   want to install, acquire the necessary rights and install with

   make install


============================================================================
  EMACS CONFIGURATION
============================================================================

Before you can enjoy prooftree you have to configure Emacs to find
prooftree and use the right versions of Proof General and Coq. Of course
you have to disable any other setting that select a particular Proof
General or Coq version.

1. Prooftree is controlled by Proof General as a subprocess of Emacs. You
   therefore have to make sure Emacs loads the right version of Proof
   General. Put

   (load-file "<pg-dir>/generic/proof-site.el")

   in your .emacs, where <pg-dir> is the installation directory of your
   version of Proof General.
