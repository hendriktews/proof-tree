  PREREQUISITES
============================================================================

Make sure you have Proof General later than June 2020 and Coq 8.11 or
better.

If you want to install Prooftree from sources you need OCaml with the Gtk
bindings from the LablGtk2 library installed. The configure script checks
if

    ocamlopt.opt -I +lablgtk2 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx

runs without errors. For Debian, installing the packages ocaml-nox and
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev suffice (but the package ocaml-native-compilers is
strongly recommended for binary compilation). For opam, package lablgtk
must be installed.


============================================================================
  INSTALLATION
============================================================================

1. Configure with

   ./configure

   optionally supply -prefix <dir> or -bindir <dir> to set the installation
   directories. 

2. Compile with

   make all

3. Acquire the necessary rights and install with

   make install


============================================================================
  EMACS CONFIGURATION
============================================================================

Before you can enjoy prooftree you have to configure Emacs to find
prooftree and use the right versions of Proof General and Coq. Of course
you have to disable any other setting that select a particular Proof
General or Coq version.

1. Prooftree is controlled by Proof General as a subprocess of Emacs. You
   therefore have to make sure Emacs loads the right version of Proof
   General. Put

   (load-file "<pg-dir>/generic/proof-site.el")

   in your .emacs, where <pg-dir> is the installation directory of your
   version of Proof General.
