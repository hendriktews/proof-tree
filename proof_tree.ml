(** {2 Updating sequents for instantiated existential variables}

    Coq prior to 8.11 can only print sequents for the current state.
   Therefore for prooftree prior to 0.14 the Proof General
   preprocessing code kept track of the instantiation status of
   existential variables and issued [Show Goal] commands synchronously
   before the next proof command in the proof was processed.

   Coq 8.11 can print sequents for older states and I removed a lot of
   preprocessing code from Proof General for prooftree 0.14. Now only
   prooftree tracks the instantiation status of existential variables
   and requests update sequent commands from Proof General via
   [show-goal] request messages when an existential appearing in some
   sequent gets instantiated. In the first design, implemented in
   August 2019, I completely relied on the information Coq provides in
   the dependent evar line. The existential variables appearing in a
   sequent were always extracted from that line. Assume that the term
   that instantiates evar [?a] uses evar [?b]. In this first design
   update sequent commands for the instantiation of [?b] can only be
   sent out for sequents for which the update sequent command for [?a]
   has been processed. It can therefore happen that some update
   sequent commands can only be issued after some round trips to Proof
   General and Coq after the current proof has been finished. This
   conflicts with the design decision to switch off the dependend evar
   line with Proof General immediately after the proof has been
   finished. The conflict produced evar parsing errors and missing
   evar information because of the missing evar line in update sequent
   commands produced after the proof has been finished.

   I therefore revised the design on the assumption that an
   existential can only occur in a sequent because it
   {ul
   {- occurs already in the initial version of the sequent, or it}
   {- occurs in the instantiation of some existential that is known
      to occur in this sequent alredy.}
   }

   Under this assumption it is sufficient to keep the dependency tree
   of existential variables downward closed on registered sequents to
   maintain the following invariant: For all complete sequents and all
   known existentian variables,
   {ul
   {- the [show goal] request message for all instantiated existentials 
      has been sent, and}
   {- all sequents are registered on all open existential variables that
      appear in them}
   }

   Here, complete sequents are sequents that have at least some
   version of sequent text. Only additionally spawned subgoals, still
   waiting for their first update sequent command, are incomplete.

   With the above invariant an update sequent command for a complete
   sequent does not trigger any [show goal] messages. These messages
   are only necessary when an existential is instantiated, when a new
   complete sequent arrives or when the first sequent text arrives for
   an incomplete sequent. Therefore, prooftree only has to delay the
   [confirm-proof-complete] message until all sequents are complete.

   However, the [show-goal] request for an incomplete sequent might be
   still on its way to Proof General when a proof is finished and the
   [proof-complete] message arrives. Therefore this module counts the
   incomplete sequents for the current proof and delays the
   [confirm-proof-complete] message until this count is zero. It is
   important to send this [confirm-proof-complete] message only after
   instantiation of existential variables, such that all [show-goal]
   messages for evar instantiation have been issued already.

(*****************************************************************************)

(** Propagate sequents registered for receiving updates on evar
   instanciation downward in the dependency tree of existential
   variables. This must be done on instantiating existential variables
   to ensure that all complete sequents are registered at all their
   evars such that an update sequent command can be triggered
   immediately when one of these evars is instantiated.

   Note that complex strategies might create and instatiate several
   evars at once and that these are processed in no particular order.
   It may therefore happen that evars used in the instantiation of a
   particular existental are instantiated themselves already. The
   downward propagation must therefore be continued recursively on all
   instantiated dependencies.

   Note further, that it is not necessary to issue update sequent
   commands for sequents added to already instantiated evars for the
   following reason. First, {!instantiate_existential} triggers update
   sequent commands for all existentials that got instantiated in a
   particular state. Second, Coq does not permit to instantiate an
   existential with a term containing an instantiated existential
   (this is actually an assumption here, that I validated with some
   [instanciate] commands). Therefore, if we see here that evar [?a]
   was instanciated with a term containing evar [?b] and [?b] is
   instantiated as well, then it must have been a complex strategy
   that first instanciated [?a] and later [?b]. And it appears as if
   [?a] and [?b] have been instanciated in the same state. Now, the
   sequents registed with [?a] are in general not registered with [?b]
   (especially not when [?b] is new). But all sequents registered with
   [?a] receive already an update for this state, because [?a] is
   instantiated here. Therefore we don't need to trigger another
   update for the same state for [?b].
