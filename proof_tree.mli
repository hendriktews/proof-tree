(** Process a current-goals command from Proof General, updating the
    proof-tree display in the right way. If the [layer_flag] is set,
    new root goals for independent proof trees are added in a new
    layer to the display. In this case there must be no open goal. If
    no proof display for [proof_name] is currently in progress, this
    function assumes that a new proof has just been started. Then a
    new proof display is created or a previous display is emptied and
    reused. If [layer_flag] is set, the [current_sequent] and the
    additional sequents (from [additional_ids]) form all root nodes of
    independent proof trees.

    If [layer_flag] is false, the following cases are distinguished,
    using {!current_proof_tree}:

    {ol
    {- The old current branch has been finished (possibly with a
    cheating command such as [admit]) and the proof assistant has
    switched to the next open goal. This case applies when the new
    current goal [current_sequent_id] is in the hash of known
    sequents and differs from the old current sequent.}
    {- A proof command has been applied to the current sequent,
    yielding a new current sequent and possibly some additional
    subgoals. This case applies
    when the new current sequent [current_sequent_id] is not in the
    hash of known sequents. As a special exception, this case does
    also apply when the new current sequent equals the old current
    sequent and is therefore found in the hash of known sequents (this
    happens if the user applied a non-failing command, that didn't
    change the goal, auch as [auto] in some cases.)

    later than [state] will be deleted. Those finished earlier than

    greater than [state] has been processed.
