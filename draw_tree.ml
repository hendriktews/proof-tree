(** Layout and drawing of the elements of the proof tree.

    Internally a proof tree is organized as an n-ary tree, where the
    nodes are proof goals and proof commands and the vertices connect
    them appropriately. This module is responsible for manipulating
    and displaying these trees and for locating nodes (e.g., on mouse
    clicks). 

    A real proof tree has a number of properties, about which this
    module is completely ignorant. For instance, the root node is
    always a proof goal; proof goal nodes have zero or more successor
    nodes, all of which are proof commands; and, finally, every proof
    command has precisely one proof-goal successor. These properties
    are neither assumed nor checked, they hopefully hold, because the
    tree is created in the right way.

    The common code of both proof-goal and proof-command nodes is in
    the class {!class: Draw_tree.proof_tree_element}. The class for proof goals,
    {!turnstile} and the class {!class: proof_command} are derived from it.
    To work around the impossible down-casts, {!proof_tree_element}
    contains some virtual method hooks for stuff that is really
    specific for just one of its subclasses.

    The tree layout functionallity has been designed such that its
    running time is independent of the size of the complete tree. When
    a new node is inserted into the tree, only its direct and indirect
    parent nodes need to recompute their layout data. No sibling node
    must be visited. To achieve this the nodes do not store absolut
    positions. Instead, nodes only store the width and height of
    themselves and of their subtrees. 

    Adjusting the tree layout when new elements are inserted works
    bottom up. Drawing the tree or looking up nodes (for mouse events)
    works top down. Therefore the nodes are organized in a
    doubly-linked tree, where children nodes contain a link to their
    parent. The doubly-linked tree functionality is in
    {!class: doubly_linked_tree}.

(** The code for marking and displaying existential variables depends
    on proper sharing of these records: For each proof-tree window
    there must only be one record for each existential variable. The
    same existential variable in different (cloned) proof trees must
    have exactly one record for each proof-tree window.

    The proof-tree record ({!Proof_tree.proof_tree}) contains a hash
    table containing all existential variables for a given proof.
    Changing the state of an existental variable and marking one in
    the proof-tree display works by side effect: All proof tree nodes
    refer to the very same instance and therefore see the state
    change.

    Sets of existential variables are stored as lists, whoose order is
    usually not important. Therefore most functions that manipulate
    lists of existential variables do not preserve the order.
